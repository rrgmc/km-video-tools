//! The shape every video song is normalized to at packaging time, and the re-encode that gets it
//! there.
//!
//! # This file is a copy, and the other one is authoritative
//!
//! The original is `tools/cmd/km-pack/src/profile.rs` in the karaoke app's repository, and that is
//! the one that *decides*: it runs inside the packager, so what it accepts is what a package
//! actually contains. This copy exists so the downloader can answer, before anything is packaged,
//! whether what arrived will be copied or re-encoded — a question worth asking at download time,
//! while the file is still in front of you and re-fetching at a different quality is one command.
//!
//! Duplicating it reverses the reason `km-pack` is a library, and the cost was accepted for one
//! reason: taking the real one meant taking `km-video` with it, and `km-video` is
//! `#![cfg(feature = "ffmpeg")]` over an unconditional audio dependency — so a downloader would link
//! ffmpeg, need libclang to build, and pull in a synthesizer, all to borrow one plain-data struct
//! and one `matches!`. [`crate::probe`] is the other half of that trade.
//!
//! **Drift is bounded rather than merely hoped for.** The numbers below are anchored to what the
//! appliance's decoder can draw, which is why the pixel format is the only [`Severity::Blocking`]
//! finding, and they have not moved since they were written. Where the two disagree, the other one
//! is right and this one is stale.
//!
//! # Why normalize at all
//!
//! So the appliance's decoder only ever meets one thing instead of whatever codec and container mix
//! a download happened to arrive in. That is the same instinct that put melody detection and the
//! suitability score at packaging time — the machine reads a fact rather than coping at run time —
//! and it costs nothing, because whatever machine did the downloading already has ffmpeg.
//!
//! # Why the check comes first
//!
//! Most files are already in the profile. A yt-dlp download asked for AVC and AAC arrives as H.264
//! in yuv420p with AAC stereo, which is exactly what is wanted, and re-encoding it would spend an
//! hour of CPU to produce a slightly worse picture. So [`Profile::check`] runs first and an empty
//! result means *copy the bytes*.
//!
//! # Two kinds of finding, and the difference matters
//!
//! [`Severity::Blocking`] means the machine cannot play the file at all. There is exactly one such
//! thing, and it is not obvious from the outside: the **pixel format**. The machine's decoder
//! copies three planes with the chroma at half height and contains no `swscale`, so anything that
//! is not 8-bit planar 4:2:0 draws wrongly — which is why it refuses such a file outright rather
//! than drawing it badly.
//!
//! [`Severity::Preference`] means the file plays, but is outside the normalized shape: VP9 instead
//! of H.264, 4K instead of 1080p, 60 fps instead of 30. Worth re-encoding for predictability and
//! disk, and never worth *refusing* over.
//!
//! Everything about the **audio** is a preference, and that is a deliberate consequence of how
//! the machine decodes: it runs a `swresample` context to interleaved stereo `f32`, so every codec,
//! sample rate and channel count already plays. The profile therefore says nothing about the sample
//! rate at all — the first real song packaged here is 44.1 kHz, and re-encoding it to 48 would
//! degrade it to fix a problem that does not exist.
